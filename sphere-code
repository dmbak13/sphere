VPython library to create a circling sphere:

from vpython import *

# Create a sphere
sphere(radius=0.5, color=color.red)

# Set initial position and velocity
pos = vector(0, 0, 0)
vel = vector(0, 1, 0)

# Set up the animation loop
while True:
    # Update the position of the sphere
    pos = pos + vel*dt
    
    # Calculate the new velocity vector
    vel = rotate(vel, angle=radians(1), axis=vector(0, 0, 1))
    
    # Update the position of the sphere
    sphere.pos = pos
    
    # Wait for a short time to slow down the animation
    rate(30)
