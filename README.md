circle sphere

This is a project that demonstrates how to create a circling sphere using Python and the VPython library.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python and the VPython library installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website, and you can install VPython using pip:

pip install vpython


Once you have Python and VPython installed, you can run the circling_sphere.py file to see the animation.

## Usage

To use this project, simply run the circling_sphere.py file using Python:

python circling_sphere.py


This will start the animation of the circling sphere. You can modify the code to change the properties of the sphere or the animation loop.
